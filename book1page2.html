                <p> Frodo recovers in Rivendell under Elrond's care. The Council of Elrond discusses the history of
                    Sauron and the Ring. Strider is revealed to be Aragorn, the heir of Isildur. Isildur had cut the One
                    Ring from Sauron's hand in a prior Age, but had refused to destroy it. It had been lost when Isildur
                    was killed, finally ending up in Bilbo's possession. Gandalf reports that the chief wizard, Saruman,
                    has betrayed them and is now working to become a power in his own right. Gandalf was captured by
                    Saruman, but escaped, explaining why he had failed to return to meet Frodo as he had promised. The
                    Council decides that the Ring must be destroyed, but that can only be done by sending it to the fire
                    of Mount Doom in Mordor, where it was forged. Frodo takes this task upon himself. Elrond, with the
                    advice of Gandalf, chooses companions for him. The Fellowship of the Ring consists of nine walkers
                    to oppose the nine Black Riders: Frodo, Sam, Merry, Pippin, Aragorn, Gandalf, Gimli the Dwarf,
                    Legolas the Elf, and Boromir, son of Denethor, the Steward of Gondor.

                    After a failed attempt to cross the Misty Mountains over the Redhorn Pass, the Fellowship take the
                    perilous path through the Mines of Moria. They learn that Balin, one of the Dwarves who accompanied
                    Bilbo in The Hobbit, and his colony of Dwarves were killed by Orcs. After surviving an attack, they
                    are pursued by Orcs and a Balrog, an ancient fire demon from a prior Age. Gandalf confronts the
                    Balrog, and both of them fall into the abyss.</p>

                        The others escape and find refuge in the timeless
                        Elven forest of Lothl√≥rien, where they are counselled by the Lady Galadriel. Before they leave,
                        Galadriel tests their loyalty, and gives them individual, more or less magical, gifts to help them
                        on their quest. She allows Frodo and Sam to look into her fountain, the Mirror of Galadriel, to see
                        visions of the past, the present, and perhaps the future.
    
                        Galadriel's husband Celeborn gives the Fellowship boats, elven cloaks, and waybread, and they travel
                        down the River Anduin to the hill of Amon Hen. There, Boromir tries to take the Ring from Frodo, but
                        immediately regrets it after Frodo puts on the Ring and disappears. Frodo chooses to go alone to
                        Mordor, but Sam, guessing what he intends, intercepts him as he tries to take a boat across the
                        river, and goes with him.<br><br><br></p>
