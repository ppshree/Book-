                <p> Bilbo celebrates his 111th birthday and leaves the Shire suddenly without warning, leaving the Ring
                    to Frodo
                    Baggins, his cousin[c] and heir. Neither hobbit is aware of the Ring's nature, but the wizard
                    Gandalf realises
                    that it is a Ring of Power. Seventeen years later, Gandalf tells Frodo that he has confirmed that
                    the Ring is
                    the one lost by the Dark Lord Sauron long ago and counsels him to take it away from the Shire.
                    Gandalf leaves,
                    promising to return by Frodo's birthday and accompany him on his journey, but fails to do so.

                    Frodo sets out on foot, ostensibly moving to his new home in Crickhollow, accompanied by his
                    gardener Sam Gamgee
                    and his cousin Pippin Took. They are pursued by mysterious Black Riders, but meet a passing group of
                    Elves led
                    by Gildor Inglorion, their chants to Elbereth warding off the Riders. The hobbits spend the night
                    with them,
                    then take a short cut to avoid their pursuers the next day, and arrive at the farm of Farmer Maggot.
                    He takes
                    them to Bucklebury Ferry, where they meet their friend Merry Brandybuck who was looking for them.
                    When they
                    reach the house at Crickhollow, Merry and Pippin reveal they know about the Ring and insist on
                    travelling with
                    Frodo and Sam. They decide to try to shake off the Black Riders by cutting through the Old Forest.
                    Merry and
                    Pippin are trapped by Old Man Willow, an evil tree who controls much of the forest, but are rescued
                    by the
                    mysterious Tom Bombadil. Leaving, they are caught by a barrow-wight in a barrow on the downs. Frodo,
                    awakening
                    from the barrow-wight's spell, manages to call Bombadil, who frees them, and equips them with
                    ancient swords
                    from the barrow-wight's hoard.</p>

                    The hobbits reach the village of Bree, where they encounter a Ranger named Strider. The innkeeper
                    gives Frodo a
                    letter from Gandalf written three months before which identifies Strider as a friend. Strider leads
                    the hobbits
                    into the wilderness after another close escape from the Black Riders, who they now know to be the
                    Nazg没l, men of
                    ancient times enslaved by lesser Rings of Power to serve Sauron. On the hill of Weathertop, they are
                    again
                    attacked by the Nazg没l, who wound Frodo with a cursed blade. Strider fights them off and leads the
                    hobbits
                    towards the Elven refuge of Rivendell. Frodo falls deathly ill; Strider treats him with the herb
                    athelas, saving
                    his life. The Nazg没l nearly capture Frodo at the Ford of Bruinen, but Strider, Sam and the Elf-lord
                    Glorfindel
                    drive the Nazg没l into the water, where flood waters summoned by Elrond, master of Rivendell, rise up
                    and
                    overwhelm them.<br><br><br><br></p>
